## Basic Concepts of CTCMP

**非点式对称(nonsymmorphic symmetry):**
平移、绕轴旋转、mirror symmetry 及其组合形成的对称性。

**linear / nonlinear drude / anomalous Hall effect:** 
linear / nonlinear
    - $j = \Sigma_k velocity \times non eq, distribution function [g_k]$ 
    - linear or nonlinear means E shows 1 time or other times of square in equation of j
    - linear: $j \propto E^1$,  nonlinear: other times.

**BCP Hall (Berry Curvature Polarize Hall):**
  - To be explained. 

> The Berry curvature is a geometrical property of an energy band which acts as a momentum space magnetic field in the effective Hamiltonian describing single-particle quantum dynamics.

**Nernst and Seebeck Effect:**

  - Basic: 
    - Gradient of temperature creates a electron distribution and replaces the electric field.
  - Nernst: $B+(-\nabla T)$ 
    - With gradient of temperature and magnetic field, current act like Hall effect.
  - Seebeck: $-\nabla T$
    - Without magnetic field, gradient of temperature creates current like electric field.

**Weak TSC(Topological Superconductors):**
- To be explained.

**$Z_2$ Nodal line semimetals**

There are several types of semimetals: nodal, nodal line, weyl semimetal.

- nodal: 

Example： One dirac point is a nodal semimetal. It turns into a weyl semimetal if the degeneration of dirac point is broken.

**Weyl semimetal**

Weyl comes from Weyl fermions. Low energy excitation of Weyl semimetal are Weyl fermions.

Weyl semimetal has gapless states in the bulk and boundary.

**Fermi arc**
